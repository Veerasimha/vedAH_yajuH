That is thy splendour O brick; do thou be hot with it for me; do thou burn with it for me; do thou shine for me as long as there are gods, with as long as the sun shines; as long as the prayer exists."

We have approached with devoted mind the young Agni who, enkindled in his seat, is shining with light inbetween the wide heaven and earth, whom ample offering has been made and who is coming from all sides. (I touch) Agni promoting intelligence, the means of a sacrifice, involving the gods, most pervading and worthy of praise. O Agni, men praise thee and none else, receiving even the least oblation. O Agni, son of Aṅgiras, we deposit thee in the manner of Manu; we enkindle thee in the manner of Manu. Do thou carry oblation to the gods for the sacrificer worshipping gods in the manner of Manu. Agni, kind to all, grants food to people. Gladdened, he ap proaches for oblation the liberal sacrificer having abundant food."[^1-1283]

The procedure upto the piling up of the naturally perforated stones is as prescribed. 

If one piles up the Vaisvasrja in an Ahīna sacrifice or a Sattra (upto the) Śatarātra, the Brahman seated in the Sadas in the Viśvajit Sarvapṛṣṭha sacrifice, recites, at the time of giving away the Dakṣiņās the Vaiśvasr̥ja mantras[^3-1285] beginning with ṛcām prācī mahatī dig ucyate by quarters and verse-halves, and the Brāhmaṇa- portions by sentences: 

(i) "The east is said to be the venerable quarter adorned by (the divinity governing) the R̥ks. The south is said to be the esteemed quarter of the Yajuses. The west is that of the Atharvans and the Aṅgirases. The north is the venerable quarter of the Sāmans.  
(ii) The god (Āditya) moves in the early part of the day together with (divinity of) the Ṛks. At midday he stands together with the Yajuses. In the evening he is worshipped together with the Sāmans. (In this way) Sūrya moves in company with the three Vedas.  
(iii)The form (of Sūrya) is said to be entirely born of the Ṛks. All movement is absolutely from the Yajuses. All (his) lustre is derived absolutely from the Sāmans. All this (belonging to Sūrya) is erected together with the sacred knowledge.  
(iv) The Vaiśya class is said to have been born of the R̥ks. Yajurveda is said to be the birth-place of the Kṣatriya class. Sāmaveda was the birth-place of the brāhmaṇa class. The old sages uttered this saying to the old persons.  

(v) The ancient gods intending to create the universe (and therefore) piling up the great Agni, became initiated and sat for the sacrificial session lasting for a hundred thousand years.  


(vi) When they commenced the Sattra for creating the universe, Tapas itself was the Gṛhapati. The collection of sacred mantras itself became the Brahman priest. The truth became the Hotr̥.  

(vii) The ambrosia functioned as the Udgātṛ for them for a thousand Parivatsaras. The past became their Prastotṛ. The future functioned as the Pratihartṛ. 

(viii) For (the gods) intending to sit for the entire session Prāṇa became the Adhvaryu. The wise Apāna chosen for the sacrifice officiated as the Pratiprasthātṛ.  
 
(ix) Those belonging to the seasons became the Upagātṛs. The seasons became the Sadasyas. The fortnights and the months became the Camasādhvaryus. 

(x) When the Viśvasrj gods sat for the sacrificial session, the lustre functioned as the Brāhmaṇācchaṁsin. Their glory became the Acchāvāka. The cosmic order became the Praśāstr̥. 

(xi) When the Viśvasrj gods performed the Sattra, their essence carried (i.e. held) king Soma.[^4-1285] Their might functioned as the Dhruvagopa.[^5-1285] Their vigour praised the pressing stones.[^6-1285]  
 
(xii) Their recompensation recited the Potṛ's yājyā. Their splendour recited the Neṣṭr̥'s yājyā. Their śraddha, knowing the truth, recited the Āgnīdhra's yājyā. 

(xiii) The sacrificial food of the Viśvasrj gods functioned as the sacrificer's wife. Their intention crushed the oblation-material. The acute hunger and thirst procured the sacrificial faggot. 

(xiv) Their speech, being aware of the compositions of metres, operating the various procedures of rituals and types of Soma-sacrifices, became the Subrahmaṇya. 

(xv) Day and night became the guardians of the sacrificial animal. The Muhurtas became the servants. The creator became the death. The lord of the people became the immolator. 

(xvi) The early Viśvasrj gods sat in a Sattra lasting for a thousand years pressing Soma every day. Consequently was born the golden bird, called Brahman, the guardian of the universe.  

(xvii) By whose prowess the suri furnished with splendour shines; at every birth the father attains parenthood through a son. One who has not studied the scripture does not realise that Almighty, the great, the soul residing in all, at death.  

(xviii) This is the eternal greatness of one who knows Brahman. By resorting to religious act he neither increases nor decreases. His self becomes cognisant of the eternity. Having cognised Him one does not become stained with evil act."

I accomplish (them) for prosperity together with Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya. (O you waters), who have wind for the horse, sun-rays for the guardians, formed of particles of light, divine impellers of creatures, do me the favour o f parenthood. Having great name, highly honoured, promoters of favourable things, divine impellers -O divine waters, do you dispel from here the consuming and burning fire, the velocity, the sin, and the poverty. O divine waters, promoting the gods, do you elevate the thunderbolt, elevate us uninjured, elevate the creation. Elevate the Ādityas and Aditi as the cause (of our prosperity)."[^5-1291] The sacrificer gives away to the Adhvaryu water together with plants with the verse- half, "May the divine waters and plants become auspicious and pleasant to us."[^6-1291]

Becoming wide, she never returns (to the original form). Similarly various dimensions of time, big and small, resorting to a year unite with it. The year covering all those dimensions becomes wide; it never returns. Therefore one should understand (the universe) to be depending upon the year in regard to the definition (of time). The year appears directly comprising small and big dimensions. One who supercedes the beings (however) does not become visible. Paṭara, Viklidha, Piṅga-these are Varuṇa's forms. When this is known, a thousand (cows) are carried. There is one head and two mouths; that defines the seasons. There are seven organs on each side. The utterance is besmeared (?).

(i) Among the rays of the sun born together the seventh is said to have been born as the first the (other) six (seasons) are shining ropes born of the god (Āditya). Their assigned destinations have been created. They function variously for the maintenance of the world.  

(ii) O men, which friend among you, not disturbed, said to his friend: “afraid of damage from us, he escapes."  

(iii) One who left away the friend enjoying friend...[^8-1291]  

(iv) A season being impelled by the (preceding) season takes its course producing appropriate sound. The groups of thirty each make sixty (in each season). The bright and dark fortnights make a part of sixty. 

(v) The spring having an old car and accompanied by the Vasus wearing coloured garments is said to be the first attendant of the year-the master. 

(vi) "Feed these, take care of these"-these talks take place at that time when the spring appears.  

(vii) One should understand the same order in regard to the change of season. We shall explain the specific characters of the seasons. Listen to them. 

(viii)The group of Rudras wearing white garments arrives together with the summer, scorching the entire earth with unparalled heat.  

(ix) Do you have a look at the variegated garments of the Ādityas yielding annual crops in association with rainy season.  

(x) The season, even though void of grief causes eye-trouble, looks yellow as if. Not causing severe cold, it appears active through antelopes. 

(xi) It gladdens the people afflicted by scorching heat. Eyes of the world become calm. The people who miss (this season in farming) miss the whole year. 
He piles up six bricks towards the south respectively with the verses:[^9-1291]  

(i) "The pupil of eyes have become clear of one relieved of eye-trouble. One anoints eyes. There is no taking away (of the eyesight).[^10-1291] Mind that all this (is the achievement) of the Rbhus.  

(ii) Do you observe (their) new garments are glittering like gold. (They say) do you consume food, cleanse yourselves. I grant you (the means of) life. 

(iii) These noises occur when there is autumn. The Maruts are shaking, hitting and stormy. 

(iv) The winds coming from yonder appear as covered with an armour in order to face the tips of arrows. People are covered with opened skirts, having various head-dresses and braided hair. 

(v) One should understand the eyes of the winter, even though not angry, as red like violent person who is fighting and whose eyes are fast moving. 

(vi) "In the midregions there is scarcity of water, (but) there is water in the residence of men"-uttering these words the people living in cold season move on experiencing the heat of lightning." 

And also with the verse, "O powerful[^11-1291] Maruts having the covering as bright as the sun, I seek your extensive favour here only." 
He piles up four (bricks, namely) hot waters with the four verses beginning with atitāmrāni attaching to each one the Santi formula at the beginning and at the end in the manner of Pravargya.[^12-1291] (The verses are):  


(i) "The Viśve Devas carry very red garments and the weapons known as Aṣṭi, Vajri and Śataghni. With the fire as the tongue (to enjoy the offering) they accompanied (other deities).  


(ii) Nobody is like myself[^13-1291]- neither any god nor a human being nor king Varuṇa the lord nor Agni nor Indra nor Soma. 

(iii) One end of his bow resides in heaven; the other on earth; Indra himself assuming the form of white ants cut its string. 

(iv) That which appears in the brilliance of the clouds is called Indra's bow without the string. It is also said to belong to Saṁyu son of Br̥haspati. It is also the bow of Rudra." 

He piles up three R̥tumaṇḍala bricks respectively with the verses, "The cold season is experienced in such a way that man stretches his eyebrows high above and is not inclined to move crossswise (consequent upon severe cold). No attention is paid to one's form or garments or to eyesight. (The opposite parties) do not dare to injure each other. This is the indication of the divine season. At sunrise one becomes red in eyes and green on head. (O cold season), thou settest down the folded palms; thou closest down the knees. Do you O men, resort to the speech. Let my knees be together; let my folded palms close together."[^14-1291] He also piles up a brick with the verse, "The drop of water, essential for agriculture dropped upon the earth reaching (the sky) due to thousands (of rays). (O Agni) do thou, showering, drop down the drop of water making sound with all strength, desired by men and coming down (from the sky)."[^14-1291]  
He piles up eight bricks with the names of Sūrya, "(Thou art) Āroga (governed by that divinity ...), Bhrājas (governed ...), Pațara, (governed ...), Pataṅga (governed ...), Svarṇara (governed...), Jyotiṣīmān (governed ...), Vibhāsa (governed...). All of them shine in the sky for this (sacrificer) yielding strength and not moving aside.”[^15-1299] He piles up the eighth with the verse, “O Kasyapa, do thou seat this (sacrificer) gloriously in that marvel of shine which is brilliant, powerful, solid, of variegated lustre and in which seven Suryas are set together."[^9-1291]

Those of impure birth, those who are born of maidens of wanton girls and women having paramours. -I separate from this place those who have swallowed semen, who have swallowed an egg, and both my sons and grandsons who are destined to go to Yama's world. -0 gods, you have assigned a life of a hundred years at which you render the bodies old and at which the sons become the fathers. (Therefore) let not our life be cut in the middle.[^41-1311] That which is the Brahman is the resort of the Pitṛs, Yama, Varuṇa, Aśvins, Agni, and the Maruts residing in the midregion. --May I attain fulfilmentof desires.

[^51-1312]: TĀ I.31 prescribes as follows: One should invoke Vaisravana with the following four verses, "Vaisravana always covered the activities of waters planned by thee. Do thou dispel our enemies who consume water. -Do thou, Vaiśravana, ascend the chariot having a thousand seats, many wheels and with a thousand horses yoked to it-the mystical power of Tvaștr, and come up to receive our Bali. May we be in the good will of (Vaiśravana) worthy of sacrifice and possessing shining wealth including plenty of food, whom human beings offer Bali consisting of wealth, cattle, elephants, gold and horses. --Thou shouldst avoid the city with a hundred doors, squares and streets, which is situated in the great mountains Sudarśana, Krauñca and Maināga.” 
If one proposes to offer Bali, he should do so with the formula, "This Bali is offered to Hiraṇyanābhi Vitudi, son of Kubera. Obeisance to the overlord of all beings. Having offered the Bali, one should pray with the verse, "Vaisravana belongs to the ruling class. We are brahmanas. Obeisance to thee; do thou not injure us. Having entered from here, do thou consume food.” One should set up the fire on which the rite is to be performed. the formula for setting the fire is: “O fire, do thou cover Bhū world; do thou cover the Bhuvaḥ world; do thou cover the Svaḥ world; do thou cover the Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ world. Do thou sit down as the overlord of all worlds." One should then enflame that fire on which the rite is to be performed. He should enflame the fire with the formulas, “Do thou cover Bhūḥ svāhā; do thou cover Bhuvaḥ svāhā, do thou cover Svaḥ svāhā; do thou cover Bhür bhuvaḥ svah svāhā. “One should perform the Vaisravana rite at that time at which the oblations (of the Arunaketuka Citi) and also those prescribed in the Brāhmaṇa are offered. Or after men go to sleep. He should offer the Bali with the formula, "I offer this big ball to him who is thy disastrous brother and who resides in my heart. May he not destroy my belongings; let them remain with me, svāhā.” He prays to Vaiśravana with the formula, "We pay obeisance to Vaisravana, the overlord of lords, the severe assaulter. May Vaisravana, the lord of desires grant the desires to me wishing the fulfilment of desires. Obeisance to kubera Vaiśravana the Mahārāja."

One (who desires to perform the Āruṇaketuka rite) should observe the vows mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa-portion. The group of vows is also measured.[^52-1312] One should not censure waters. As mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa-portion one should entertain one desire or all desires.   

[^52-1312] TĀ I.32. One should observe this vow; or for two months. The specific vows are : he should bathe thrice a day. He should havew food and drink every fourth time. (That is to say, after having food and drink in the morning, he should further have them next day evening). Or he may ask for food every day and eat. He should worship Agni with fire-sticks of Ficus glomerata with the Anuvāka beginning with punar mām aitu îndriyam (TĀ I.30). He should fulfil the purpose of water with the water drawn (from river etc.) and cleansed. He should not preserve any belongings. He should make Vrata- offerings to Agni, Vāyu, Sūrya, Brahman, Prajāpati, Candramas; Nakṣatras, Rtus, Saṁvatsara, Varuṇa and Aruņa. The rules applicable to the study of Pravargya-mantras are applicable also here. Offerings should also be made to Aruṇa Kāṇḍa-ṛṣis. One should study these mantras in the forest. He should murmur the two verses beginning with bhadram karnebhiḥ (TĀ I.1.1.), and touch water with Mahānāmni mantras. The teacher should initiate him. The latter should touch plants with sivā naḥ samtamā... and the earth with sumṛḍīkā... (TĀ I.1.3). He should do similarly at the conclusion of the study A milch-cow should be given as Dakṣiṇa, also a bronze-vessel and a linen piece of cloth; or any other garment according to one's capacity. In this way one should conduct his study in a forest following the above-mentioned rules for learning. Thus he becomes full of devotion and holy.
