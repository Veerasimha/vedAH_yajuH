"(1) May the wind residing in the midregion blow auspiciously for us. May the sun illumine auspiciously for us. May the days be auspicious for us. May the night be auspicious. 
(2) May the dawn shine auspiciously for us. May the sun rise auspiciously for us. O Sarasvati, do thou become most auspicious and favourable to us. Let there be no emptiness under thy supervision. 
(3) (O earth) thou art the residence of Iḍā. Thou art possessed of residence. May we not be deprived of residence. Let him be without residnece who hates us and whom we hate. 
(4) Thou art stability, may we be possessed of stability; may we not be deprived of stability. Let him be without stability who hates us and whom we hate. 
(5) O wind, do thou carry remedy; carry away what is evil. Possessed of all remedies, thou movest as the messenger of gods.  

(6) These two winds blow as far as the ocean and as far as the farthest regions. May the one bring forth grace; may the other carry away what is evil. 
(7) Owind, the treasure of ambrosia which is deposited in thy house-do thou give us a part of it for our life; do thou give us remedy out of it; do thou bring lustre out of it. 
(8) May the wind, gracious and auspicious to our minds, bring forth remedy; may he extend our life. 
(9) (O Sun) thou art the home of Indra. I submit to thee with the cows, the horses and what is mine. 
(10) I resort to Bhūḥ; I resort to Bhuvaḥ: I resort to Suvaḥ: I resort to Bhur Bhuvaḥ Suvaḥ. I resort to Vāyu, I resort to the health-giving divinity. I resort to the unbreakable rock. I resort to Brahman, the treasure of Brahman belonging to Prajāpati; I resort to the Praṇava. 
(11) May the midregion be wide for me; the fires and mountains be great. May the wind grant me the grace with which it blows. May our minds be full of grace. (12) O Prāṇa and Apāna, do you guard me from death. O Prāṇa and apāna, do you not leave me.   

(13) May Agni place within me intellect, offspring and lustre. May Indra place within me intellect, offspring and strength. May Sūrya place within me intellect, offspring and brilliance. 
(14) O Aśvins, do you guard us with brilliant food and uninjured fortunes. May Mitra, Varuṇa, Aditi, Sindhu, and Dyāvāpr̥thivī glorify our gain.  
(15) With what help, with which most powerful help will the wonderful and evergrowing friend come to us? 
(16) Which of the intoxication of the drink, truthful and the most bountiful, will intxicate thee so that thou shalt break the closed treasures? 

(17) Do thou become the guardian of us, thy praising friends, with a hundred aids.
(18) Priyamedha R̥ṣis approached Indra for seeking help like the fair-winged birds. Do thou (O Indra), clear the darkness, grant the sight; release us who are fastened as if with a cord. 
(19) May the divine waters be auspicious to us for protection and favourable drinking. May they flow happiness and welfare towards us. 
(20) I ask for remedy to the waters which are capable of granting boons and providing shelter to men. 
(21) May the waters and plants be friendly to us and unfriendly to him who hates us and whom we hate. 
(22) O waters, you are welfare bringing; do you grant us strength so that we may see the great good.  

(23) Give us here your most gracious essence like the dear mothers. 
(24) We aproach you for that essence whose presence you like. O waters, create that essence for us. 
(25) The earth is appeased; it is appeased by fire. Appeased, may it appease my ailment. 
(26) The midregion is appeased; it is appeased by the wind. Appeased, may it appease my ailment. 
(27) The heaven is appeased, it is appeased by the sun. Appeased, may it appease my ailment. 
(28) The earth is the appeasement, midregion the appeasement, heaven the appeasement, quarters the appeasement, intermediate quarters the appeasement, fire the appeasement, mind the appeasement, sun the appeasement, moon the appeasement, constellations the appeasement, waters the appeasement, plants the appeasement, herbs the appeasement, cow the appeasement, she-goat the appease- ment, horse the appeasement, man the appeasement, appeasement itself the appeasement. May there be appeasement for me. 

(29) With that appeasement, the entire appeasement, I cause appeasement for myself, the two-footed and four footed. May there be appeasement for me. 
(30) May radiance, modesty, restraint, penance, intellect, stability, faith, truth and law rise up following me who am rising up. May radiance, modesty, restraint, penance, intellect, stability, faith, truth, and law not leave me. 
(31) I have risen up following the immortal gods with life, good life, essence of plants and the strength of rains.  
(32) May we perceive for a hundred autumns the brilliant eye placed in the east by gods. May we live for a hundred autumns; may we prosper for a hundred autumns; may we rejoice for a hundred autumns; may we succeed for a hundred autumns, may we hear for a hundred autumns, may we speak for a hundred autumns; may we be unconquered for a hundred autumns so that we may be able to behold the sun for ever.  
(33) May the sun, the red-eyed bull, wise, who, illuminating, has come up from the middle of the water of the great ocean, purify my mind. 
(34) Thou art the dropper of the Brahman; you two are the leaders of the Brahman, thou art the support of Brahman. This large earth is supported by the Brahman; the wide region is supported by him, he has supported the heaven and earth together with the gods. May I realize what I know. May the Veda not be loosened from me. 
(35) May the intellect and grasping faculty enter me concurrently for the attainment of the past and future. May I enjoy the whole span of life. 
(36) O Indra, being supported with these utterances, do thou fill up for us what is wanting here. When thou hast broken the big stables for the purpose of thy worshippers, we shall be receiving plenty from thee.  
(37) We have pronounced the Brahman; may it now leave us. Om. (Let there be) appeasemnent, appeasement, appeasement."[^6-491]

The Āgnīdhra, having sat down to the rear of the Gārhapatya and having taken out embers to the west by means of the stirring sticks, lays down upon them two potsherds for Rauhiṇa cakes. Having thickly mixed the flour with water he puts the Rauhiṇa cakes on fire. He pours out clarified butter; puts it on fire. Having carried fire around both (the cakes and clarified butter), he bakes the Rauhiṇa cakes. At this juncture the Pratiprasthātr̥ touches the implements to be used at the offering by means of the Veda of Muñja—the Mahāvīra, the spoon, the milking pots; the ladles to be used for offering the Rauhiṇa cakes and the supporting ladle. Having purified the clarified butter, having taken out the Rauhiṇa cakes (in a pan), having first spread clarified butter as base and after having poured clarified butter over them and having placed them on the Rauhiṇa-ladles, he places them within the altar

Thy Havirdhāna is having feet; Agni is thy superintendent; Rudra the overlord. May I meet with long life, splendour, milk, lordship over cows and welfare. May he be without him who hates us and whom we hate. The manly yellowish (Pravargya) is making noise, the great, handsome as the sun. He shines along with the sun. Thou art intelligence, the womb of ocean, brilliant, mighty, an eagle, righteous, an active bird having golden wings, the great seated in thy seat with stability. Obeisance be to thee; do thou not injure me. The waters have perceived Viśvāvasu Gandharva, the bringer of Soma. They met him with law. He followed them. Active Indra saw with them the enclosures of the sun. May Viśvāvasu the heavenly Gandharva measuring the midregion approve of what is truth and what we do not know.

Of a dreadful wild sheep or a wild animal living in boughs[^9-533] cries, one follows that crying with the formula, "The cry which the dreadful wild sheep has made being forced by somebody or of its own will, O Indra-Agni, knowing it by divine knowledge, do you turn it as auspicious in our home."[^10-535] If a she-wolf cries, one follows her with the formula, "O long-mouthed one, bad-chinned, do not cry towards the south. If thou criest towards the south, distress my enemy."[^11-535] 
If a male or female owl cries, one follows it with the formula, “The owl, golden-eyed, iron-faced, has come hither. The messenger of the Rakṣases has come; O Agni, drive it out from here."[^12-535] If a frantic noise occurs, one follows it with the formula, "O Piśācā-haunted man, remove towards our enemies the uncommon sound which thou hast uttered. O death, carry them towards death. Let them meet with distress through distress. May Agni be in harmony with Agni."[^13-535]  

If a bird attacks the Gharma-yielding cow or the Mahāvīra, one follows it with the formula, "O crow, thou fliest spreading thy legs; thou closest the left eye. Let nobody become ill here."[^14-535] If worms are produced on the body of the Charma-yielding cow or in the Mahāvīra, one should wash them with water with the formula, "O worm, I kill thee through Atri, Kaṇva and Jamadagni. Thou art killed by the divine song of Viśvāvasu. The king of worms, even their leader is killed. Its mother and father, big as also small worms, black as also white worms, also Āśātikas have been killed. All together with white worms have been killed."[^15-535] If, while the Mahāvīra is set on fire,[^16-535] an enemy enters, one should offer a spoonful on the Gārhapatya with the formula, "Bring forth, take out portion as of a cooked oblation; truly I place N.N. under the jaws of Yama. Be it so khaṇ, phaṇ. Thou art killed."[^17-535]
