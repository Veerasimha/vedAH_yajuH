The Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra together with an English translation is being presented here in four volumes. There will be other volumes also presenting Bhavasvāmin's bhāṣya and the word-index of the sūtra-text. The 
Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra belongs to the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda Taittirïya recension. It represents the oral lectures delivered by the teacher Baudhāyana, hence is the oldest śrauta-text. The text is revised here in the light of the variant readings recorded by W. Caland in his first edition (Calcutta 1906), and is presented in a readable form. The mantras forming part of the sutras have been fully rendered into English. The translation is supplied with notes giving reference to the mantras and explanations of the ritual. The work is expected to serve as an advancement of Taittiriya ritualistic studies.
