According to tradition, the sadas (shed) is 9 aratnis wide and 27 aratnis long in the south-north direction; according to some, its length is 18 aratnis. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at 15, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by 41⁄2 (aratnis).
According to tradition, the uparavas are each 1 prādeśa long, separated from one another by 1 prādeśa. A square of side equal to 1 aratni is made, poles are fixed at the (four) corners, and a circle of radius equal to half prādeśa is drawn (with each pole at the corner as centre) as per tradition.

According to tradition, the gārhapatya fire has the measure of 1 vyāyāma. It is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
1
The brick (to be used for the gårhapatya fire) is to measure | vyāyāma (32 angulas) long by ✈ vyāyāma (13 añgulas 24 tilas) wide. There are 21 such bricks (required for each layer). In the first layer, the length (of the brick) is turned towards east, and in the second layer towards north.
For the circular (gārhapatya fire), a circular mound of earth is made and a pole fixed at the middle. (With this pole as centre) a circle is drawn with (a radius equal to) | vyāyāma plus the extra (as per rule 3.2 for transforming a square into a circle). Within it (the circle) a square of the maximum size possible is drawn and divided into 9 parts (squares); each segment of the circle (between the circumference and the square) is to be divided into 3 parts.
In the placement (of bricks), the corners of square (in the first layer) point towards intermediate directions; in the other layer, these corners lie at the centres (of the segments of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
· The dhiṣnya fire, according to tradition, has the measure of the wooden vessel (pisilamātra); it is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
Having made a circular mound of earth, the āgnīdhriya fire is divided into 9 parts and a stone is to be placed. The other (dhiṣṇya fire) is divided into as many parts as prescribed and covered with bricks as they fit.

The tradition has it that he who constructs the fire-altar is certain to be (rich). It is constructed in the likeness of the birds, that is, after their shape, in pursuance of express direction (in the matter).
With the help of a bamboo rod of length (equal to a purușa) as mentioned, 4 (square) purușas are measured out for the body (of the fire-altar) and 1 (square) purușa is measured out for each of the southern wing, the northern wing and the tail. The southern wing is lengthened towards south by 1 aratni and likewise the northern wing towards north. The tail is lengthened towards west by 1 pradeśa or 1 vitasti.
The first agni is one-fold (11⁄2 sq. purușa); the second two-fold (21 sq. purușa); the third three-fold (31⁄2 sq. purușa) and so on; in this way one continues upto hundred-and-one-fold agni (1011 sq. purușa).
But indeed the seven-fold (agni) only is to be constructed (first); (for) the seven-fold is the proper fire-altar. Thereafter, higher altars (are obtained) by increasing the area by one (sq. purusa) successively; this is the tradition.

The one-fold and the following (fire-altars up to the six-fold) do not have wings and tails, but the seven-fold does (have them) according to the injunc- tions of the Śruti.
In the case of eight-fold and higher order fire altars, their differences in area from the seven-fold should be divided in seven and half equal parts and each part added to each purușa (of the original seven-fold altar). This is because the deformation (of the fire-altar) is disallowed in the Śruti.
According to tradition, (the term) to be measured with a puruşa means 'to be measured with a bamboo rod'.
9
Two holes are made (at the ends of) a bamboo rod at a distance equal to the height of the sacrificer with uplifted hands, and a third hole is made at the middle. Having placed the bamboo rod along the east-west line, poles are fixed in the holes from the western extremity; two poles from the western side are then taken off, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the eastern extremity) with the other end (from the west) towards south-east. The pole is then removed from (the hole in) the eastern extremity and fixed at the western extremity, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the western extremity) with the other end (from the east) towards south-west. The bamboo rod is taken off and one end of it is fixed to the middle (of the east- west line) with a pole; it is then placed towards the south so as to pass over the point of intersections of the two circles and a pole is fixed in the hole at the other extremity. The bamboo rod is fixed to this (last) pole by its middle hole and laid (east-west) touching the outer edges of the two circles; two poles are fixed through the two extreme holes. This is a square of (side equal to) one purușa.
Going about in this way, four squares each of one (sq.) purușa in the body (ātman) are measured out. One (sq) purușa (is then measured out) for each of the southern wing, the tail and the northern wing. As stated, the southern wing is to be increased towards south by one aratni and so on.
A bamboo rod equal to the diagonal of a square of side one purușa is placed across from (the western end of) the east-west line and another (rod of one purușa) is placed on the east side (from the eastern end). By them (that is, by their meeting point) the south-east corner is fixed. By reversing (the place- ment of the two rods), the south-west corner is fixed. Proceeding as before, the north-east corner is fixed.
As in the case of the uttara vedi, it is measured out with the help of a cord or a bamboo rod.
When the fire-altar having wings and tail is increased to higher folds or reduced, the saptamakarani of the fold (vidha) is to be substituted by the puruşa and the area (of the fire-altar) drawn.TRANSLATION

Of the bricks, the side (of the first type) should measure one-fifth of a purușa ; the second type has one of its sides longer by half; the third type is one-fifth of a purușa long and one prādesa broad; bricks with each side equal to one prādeśa form the fourth type; square bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa) constitute the fifth type.
The height of the brick is to be made a fifth of the jānu and that of the nākasat and pañcacoḍā half of that measure.
What is lost by burning (and drying) is to be made good by loose earth because of the flexibility of its quality.

In the placement (of bricks), 10 bricks longer by half (that is, 36 ang×24 ang) and turned towards west are placed on the east side of the body (ātman); 10 (of them) turned towards east on the west side (of the body); 5 (of them) at each end of the two wings; 5 (of them) at both junctions of the wings (with the body) such that half of the bricks (that is, the added half 12 ang of the adhyardhā) lie in the wings; and 5 bricks turned towards north and south on both sides of the tail.
After placing bricks of side equal to 1 prādeŝa in the tail, all the (remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a puruşa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purusa).
In the other layer, 10 bricks longer by half and turned towards north are placed on the south side of the body and 10 (of them) turned towards south on the north side (of the body). (The placement of bricks) in the tail will be the same as in the wings for the first layer and that in the wings the same as in the tail (for the first layer). In the junction (between the tail and the body), (the placement of bricks should be) in the reverse order.
The whole (of the remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa). (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
There are five layers; these are covered with five (layers of) loose earth, ending up with a layer of earth; (this is done) for various purposes (served by) loose earth.
10.8 The construction of the fire-altar for the first time should be with 1000 bricks upto (the height of) the knee; for the second time with 2000 bricks upto (the height of) the navel; for the third time with 3000 bricks upto (a height of) the mouth; and so on upto higher and higher heights. Those who
110
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASÚTRA
desire heaven should construct by increasing the height measure with innumerable bricks; this is the tradition.
10.9 In the case of (fire-altars employing) 2000 bricks, the piles will be two layered; in the case of 3000 bricks, three layered; in the case of 4000 and larger number of bricks, the number of bricks (for the layer) remains the same (as that for the 3000).
10.10 According to tradition, a smaller fire-altar should not be laid after a larger
one has been constructed.
11.1
11.2

According to tradition, the fire-altar is to be constructed with four sided (bricks); in the absence of anything mentioned in particular, a square is to be understood.
(The bricks should be) of the measure of pada, aratni, urvasthi and aṇuka; this is the tradition.
11.3 anūka is one-fourth (of a purușa), aratni one-fifth (of a purușa), and so is ūrvasthi
(one-sixth of a purușa).
11.4
11.5
11.6
The quarter bricks have the measure of a păda; there one is free to choose owing to the wide range of the meaning of the word (pada).
In the placement (of bricks), 8 bricks of size quarter of the one-fourth (that is, 15 x 15 sq. ang.) are to be placed at each end of the two wings and 8 similar bricks at the (two) junctures (between the wing and the body) such that 6 angulas (of the bricks) lie within the body. 8 bricks (of the same type) are placed on the western corners (of the body, 4 on each, lined) towards east and 8 bricks on the eastern corner towards west.
In the space (of the body) between the two junctures (with the wings), bricks of size one-fifth (of a purusa) and their quarters (are placed).
11.7 After placing bricks of size equal to 1 prādeśa in the tail, the whole of the
(remaining space of the) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fourth bricks.
11.8 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
11.9
In the other layer, one-fifth bricks are placed in the middle of the juncture of the tail (with the body). 14 bricks of size quarter of them (of one-fifth, that is, 12 x 12 sq. ang.) are placed around in the body as they fit.
11.10 The whole of the (remaining) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fifth bricks. 11.11 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
12
12.1 For one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold fire-altar), square bricks of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side (of the fire-altar) are to be made

111
as also their quarters. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
From one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold), bricks are used in the first, second and third construction; in all cases and also for higher constructions, their number is according to the prescription of the Śruti (that is, 1000 bricks for all constructions).
12.3 The kamya (fire-altars) are (endowed with) different merits and (are prescribed for the fulfilment of special desires) according to the science of merits (guṇaśāstra).
12.4 Those who have many foes should construct a (fire-altar in the form of an
isosceles) triangle; this is the tradition.
12.5 A square twice as large as the area of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is laid; the mid-point of the eastern side (of the square) is joined to the two western corners (of the square, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact triangle (equal in area to the seven-fold fire-altars of 71⁄2 sq. puruṣa).
12.6 Bricks are to be made as in the case of one-fold etc. fire-altars (that is, of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side of the altar); these should have the shape of an isosceles triangle.
12.7 According to tradition, those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus (made of two isosceles triangles, ubhayata prauga).
12.8
This (rhombus) looks like two inverted (fore parts) of a cart (joined together). As in the case (of the isosceles triangle), a rectangle (twice the area of 7 sq. purușa) is constructed and the mid-points of the eastern and western sides are joined to the mid-points of the southern and northern sides (of the rectangle, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact rhombus. (Bricks for this fire-altars are to be made in the same manner) as described in the case of the isosceles fire-altars.
12.9 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel is to be
constructed (when it is desired) to destroy enemies.
12.10 A circle of area equal to that of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is made and the largest possible square is inscribed in it.
13
13.1
13.2
Bricks (for the construction of the chariot wheel fire-altar) are made with the twelfth part of the side (of the inscribed square).
6 of these (bricks) are placed in each circular segment and the remaining space (of the segment) is divided into 8 parts.

In the placement (of the first layer), the corners of the square should lie in the intermediate directions and in the other layer in the centres of the segments (of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
According to tradition, those who desired food should construct a fire-altar in the form of a trough.
The troughs are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular. One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
13.7 Rather from considerations of quality a square (dronacit) should be cons-
tructed.
13.8 According to tradition, the handle (of the trough) should lie on (its) western
side.
13.9 The area of the handle is one-tenth of the total area (of the fire-altar). This being placed in the form of the tail (separate from the body), the area (of the square body) is found by the difference (of two squares) as already stated.
13.10 The (square) bricks are to be made with the twelfth part of the side (of the square body). Bricks longer by half (adhyardhā) and quarter bricks are also made.
13.11 In the placement (of the bricks in the first layer), the bricks longer by half are arranged on the eastern side of the body, turned towards west, at the (west) end of the handle and at the two western corners (of the body).
13.12 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.13 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
13.14 In the other layer, the bricks longer by half are placed along the southern side of the body, turned towards north and along the northern side, turned towards south; the same is done along the southern and the northern side of the handle.
13.15 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.16 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.

and levelled with clay with water (purîșa); this is the tradition.

Those who desire villages should construct the paricayya (fire-altar); this is the tradition.
The paricayya is that (fire-altar) in which bricks are placed around the central svayamātṛṇṇā (brick).
14.6 According to tradition, the upacayya is to be constructed by those who desire villages. It is prepared in a manner opposite to that of the paricāyya (that is, the construction proceeds from outside to the centre).
14.7
14.8
14.9
Those who desire prosperity in the abode of the Fathers should construct the fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit); this is the tradition.
The pyres are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular.
One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
14.10 Rather from considerations of quality a square (śmaśānacit) should be cons- tructed. In the square type, it should be like the trough without the handle, as already stated.
14.11 According to tradition, those who desire beasts should construct the fire-
altar with the meters (in place of bricks).
14.12 According to one opinion, the entire (sacrificial ceremony) should be per- formed by means of meters, according to another, by the usual sacrificial fires.

Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
The (area of the) fire-altar is to be made seven-fold with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. (Of the rectilinear syenacit), the prādeśa (portion of the tail) and the fourth part of the body (atman) together with 8 caturbhāgīyās (also from the body) (are to be taken out). Out of these (areas), three (caturbh- āgiyās) form the head (of the falcon) and the remaining (area) is to be distributed between the two wings.
5 aratnis make 1 purușa, 4 aratnis 1 vyāyāma, 24 añgulas 1 aratni and half (of 24 añgulas, that is, 12 añgulas) 1 prādeśa. That is the definition.
15.5
The length of the wing is 9 aratnis and angulas.
114
15.6
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASŪTRA
A tie is made at either end of a cord 2 purușas long and a mark given at the middle (of the cord). Having fastened the ties at the two western corners of the (southern) wing, the cord is stretched towards east by the mark; the same is done on the eastern side (of the wing). This makes the bending (of the wing). Thereby is explained (the bending of) the northern wing.
15.7 The body is 2 purușas long and 11⁄2 purușas broad.
15.8
15.9
At the place of the tail, a rectangle puruşa broad and 1 purușa long towards west is constructed; a similar rectangle is constructed on its southern and northern side. These (latter, i.e. the southern and the northern) two (rectangles) are diagonally cut off such that the length (of the tail) at its juncture (with the body) is purușa.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off).
16
16.1
16.2
The western and the eastern corners (of the body) are cut off (by lines) in the direction of the junctures (of the body with the tail and the head). This is the (form) of the falcon.
Bricks are made with length equal to one-fifth purușa (24 añg) and breadth one-sixth purușa (20 ang.), the two sides being inclined (with each other) in such a way that these fit (with the shape of the wing). This is the first type.
16.3 Two of these (first type) bricks are joined along the east line (that is, the
length). This is the second type.
16.4
16.5
16.6
That side of the first type, which is one-sixth purușa long is extended by one- eighth of a purușa (15 añg), and (the extended part) is bent so as to fit (with the shape of the fire-altar). This is the third type.
A (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purușa (30 ang) is lengthened by half; the (square) portion of side one-fourth purușa is diagonally cut off. This is the fourth type.
The fifth type of brick is half of the (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purusa.
16.7 By dividing it (the fifth type) by the diagonal, the sixth type (is obtained).
16.8
A rectangle of breadth one-tenth of a purușa (12 ang) and length one-fifth of a purușa (24 añg) in the direction from east to west is drawn. One each such rectangle is placed on its southern and its northern side. These two (latter, that is, the southern and the northern, rectangles) are cut off by diagonals passing through their south-west corners. This is the seventh type.
TRANSLATION
115
16.9 Like-wise another type is formed in which the northern rectangle is cut off by the diagonal passing through the north (-western) corner (the cutting off of the southern rectangle being as before). This is the eighth type.
16.10 The ninth type is obtained by dividing by both diagonals a (square) brick
of side one-fourth of a purușa.
16.11 In the placement (of bricks in the first layer) 60 bricks of the first type turned
towards north, are placed in each wing.
16.12 Along each side of the tail, 8 bricks of the sixth type are placed (in this way); three of them at the end (of the tail) and one above them and again three and one (above them).
16.13 At the juncture of the tail (with the body), 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the tail and the body) are placed. West of them (are placed) 2 bricks of the fifth class touching each other edge to edge.
17.1
17.2
17.3
17
The remaining space (of the tail) is covered by 10 bricks of the fourth type. 8 bricks of this type, turned towards east and west, are placed in the four corners (of the body).
The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 26 bricks of the fourth, 8 of the sixth and 4 of the fifth type.
In the head 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the head and the body) are placed and 2 of the same type, turned towards east, above them.
17.4 Thus is formed the (first) layer of 200 bricks.
17.5
17.6
17.7
17.8
In the other layer, 5 bricks of the second type are to be placed at each of the two bendings (of the two wings). At either juncture (of the wing with the body) (5) bricks of the third type are placed in such a way that the portion of each brick extended by one-eighth puruşa lies within the body. The remain- ing space (of each wing) is covered by 45 bricks of the first type, turned towards east.
5 bricks of the seventh type are placed along each of the two sides of the tail. Next to such brick in the second row on one side and in the fourth row on the other side, one brick each of the seventh type is to be placed. The remaining space (of the tail) is to be covered by 13 bricks of the eighth type.
8 bricks of the fourth type, turned towards south and north, are placed in the western and the eastern corners (of the body). The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 20 bricks of the fourth type, 30 bricks of the sixth and 1 brick of the fifth type.
In the head are placed 2 bricks of the fourth type and east of them 4 bricks of the ninth type.
116
ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASŪTRA
17.9 Thus is formed the (second) layer of 200 bricks.

Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
18.2 This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
120 (square) bricks each of a (square) purușa (side, † pu. or 30 ang) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. pu.) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. Of them, 40 (can be accommodated) in the body (ātman), 3 in the head, 15 in the tail, 31 in the southern wing and the same (number) in the northern (wing).
18.3
18.4
18.5
A rectangle, 11⁄2 purușa broad and 2 purușas long, is constructed. (An area equal to) 2 bricks of th (square purușa) is discarded from each of the two western and the eastern corners, leaving (an area equivalent of) 40 (sodasi) bricks. This is the body.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off). (An area equivalent of) 3 (ṣoḍaśi) bricks is left. This is the head.

18.6 A rectangle of breadth 1 puruşa and length 2 purusas, further extended by an area of square puruşa makes the southern wing. Likewise (is made) the northern wing.
18.7
18.8
At the end of (each) wing, 4 squares of side equal to † of a purușa are made, diagonally divided, and their halves discarded. An area (equivalent of) 31 (ṣoḍaśī) bricks is left.
In the middle of the wing less the end portion (that is purușa or 30 ang with which the 4 squares were made), an east-west line is drawn. From (the western point of) the juncture of the wing (with the body) a cord of length 1 purușa is stretched and a point at the end of 1 purușa is given (where the end of the cord meets the east-west line). At a distance of 1 puruşa from this point towards east another point is given. From these two points lines are to be drawn to the different end points (of the wing at the junction with the body and at the end less puruşa where the 4 squares were made). This is the curving of the (southern) wing. Thus is explained (the curving of) the northern wing.

(An area bounded by a length of) 2 purușas on the western side, 1⁄2 puruşa on the eastern side, √/18 (times ‡ purușa or 30 ang) on each of the two (southern and northern) sides and having a height of puruşa can accommodate 15 (ṣoḍaśi) bricks. This is the tail.
19.2 The one-sixteenth (ṣoḍaśī) brick is to be bounded by four sides (whose
measures are) : † purușa, § purușa, ‡ purușa and √ purușa.
19.3
A half brick is bounded by three sides, two sides by † purușa each and the other by V2 purușa.
19.4 A quarter brick is bounded by three sides,-one side by 1 purușa and the other
two by V purușa each.
19.5
A brick for use in the wing (pakṣeṣṭakā) is bounded by four sides, two sides by ‡ purușa each and the other two by purușa each.
19.6 A brick for use in the

middle of the wing (pakṣamadhyāyā) is bounded by four
puruşa each and the other two by purușa each.
A brick for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgrīyā) is bounded by three sides, -one side by purușa, one side by (+7) purușa, and the remaining side by ( √ + 4) purușa.
For making the brick for use in the wing (pakṣeṣṭakā) a rectangle of breadth puruşa and length puruşa is made and then lengthened by a diagonal (so that the other diagonal is shortened and the figure assumes the form of a parallelogram). The slabs are bent by the seventh of the distance between the root (apyaya) and the bending point of the wing (pakṣanamanī).
In the placement (of bricks), 4 quarter bricks are placed in the east of the head, 5 on the western side of the juncture of the head (with the body), 11 on the eastern side of the (eastern) juncture of the wings (with the body), 11 on the western side of the (western) juncture of the wings (with the body), 5 on the eastern side of the juncture of the tail (with the body) and 5 on the west of it, and 15 at the end of the tail.

4 bricks for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgriyā) are each placed at the end of the two wings and 4 at the juncture of the wing (with the body) each lying partly in both (the wing and the body).
Around these latter (pakṣāgrīyā bricks partly lying) in the body, 4 one- sixteenth bricks are placed on either side as these fit.
4 bricks for use in the middle of the wing (pakṣamadhyiyā) are each placed in the middle of the two wings. The two wings are (then) to be covered by

bricks for use in the wings (pakṣeṣṭakā), (the longer sides of the bricks being) turned towards east.
The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides (of these bricks) are to face outwards; elsewhere. (their placement should be) as in the head.
In the other layer, 2 one-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed in the east of the head; west of them two of these with their diagonal sides facing inwards (are to be placed) partly covering the head and the body.
2 half bricks are to be placed as these fit, and these are to be enclosed by 2 half bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards.
One-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed where the sides of the body meet (that is, at the western and eastern corners).
4 half bricks (are to be placed) at each end of the two wings. Two wings are (then) to be covered with bricks for use in the wings (pakṣeṣṭakā), (their longer sides) turned towards north.
20.9 3 half bricks (are to be placed) at either side of the tail.
20.10 The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides are to face outwards, elsewhere (their placement should be) as in the tail.
20.11 If square or triangular areas arise (due to the removal of ṣoḍaśī bricks for completing the number 200), these are to be covered by half or quarter bricks. Aņukās in the place of pañcadaśabhāgījās (are to be placed).
20.12 (With these two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired
are to be constructed.

21.1 The kite-shaped fire-altar (kankacit) and the fire-altar in the form of an alaja
bird are explained after the falcon-shaped (fire-altar).
21.2
21.3
Like the falcon their two wings are larger than the tail and more curved (at the middle); the inclined tail is long (at the end and short where it joins with the body); neither the body nor the head is circular. This is according to the scriptures. Or, in pursuance of the sacred tradition, (the fire-altar may be) without the head.
And it is taught thus: 'One who wishes to live with the head on in this world should provide the kankacit with the head'. Why is it said when one (always) has (the head)?TRANSLATION

21.4 Naturally the two wings are curved and the tail is narrowed because such modifications are so heard. Where no (such) modification is heard, the body retains its natural form.
21.5
Thus it is constructed in the form of the falcon, and the shape has been explained after the sacred tradition.
21.6 According to tradition, the fire-altar for the afvamedha (sacrifice) is three
times as large (as the seven-fold with aratni and prādeśa).
21.7
All (sorts of) enlargements are possible in this case as nothing particular is mentioned.
21.8 The enlargement of the wings and the tail is stated to be brought about by
the addition of rectangles.
21.9
It is (further) taught that, for the aśvamedha sacrifice, the fire-altar is of twenty-one.
